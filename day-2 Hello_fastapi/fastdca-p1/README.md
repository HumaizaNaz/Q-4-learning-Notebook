FastAPI Project
What is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance Python web framework designed for building APIs quickly and efficiently. It is lightweight, scalable, and leverages Python's type hints to provide a developer-friendly experience.

Purpose: FastAPI simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs for web and mobile applications, microservices, and more.
Example: It can power an API that delivers user data or product information to a mobile app.

Key Features

High Performance:

Built on Starlette and Pydantic, FastAPI offers performance comparable to Node.js and Go, thanks to its asynchronous capabilities (async/await).


Automatic Documentation:

Generates interactive API documentation (Swagger UI/ReDoc) accessible at <http://localhost:8000/docs>.


Data Validation:

Uses Pydantic for automatic data validation, ensuring correct data types and reducing errors.


Developer-Friendly:

Easy-to-write code with Python type hints, clear error messages, and minimal boilerplate.



Use Cases

Web Application Backends: APIs for mobile apps, web apps, or IoT devices.
Microservices: Independent services for payment systems, authentication, etc.
Machine Learning: Deploy ML models via APIs (e.g., image recognition).
Prototyping: Rapidly test and build proof-of-concept APIs.
Real-Time Apps: Support for chat apps or live dashboards with async features.

Why FastAPI?
FastAPI was created by Sebastián Ramírez in December 2018 to address the limitations of older frameworks like Flask and Django REST. Its goals were to:

Deliver high performance using modern Python features (Python 3.6+).
Be easy to use with minimal code for maximum output.
Provide automatic features like documentation, validation, and error handling.

Today, FastAPI is widely used by companies like Netflix, Uber, and Microsoft due to its speed, simplicity, and robust ecosystem.
Why It's Useful

Speed: Asynchronous support ensures fast request handling.
Ease of Learning: Intuitive for Python developers.
Auto-Generated Docs: No need to write separate documentation.
Type Safety: Reduces bugs with Python type hints.
Strong Community: Integrates with tools like Uvicorn and Pydantic.

Project Setup
To set up a FastAPI project using UV (a Python package and project manager), follow these steps:

Install UV:

For Windows:pip install uv

ORpowershell -c "irm <https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1> | iex"


For Mac/Linux:curl -LsSf <https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh> | sh




Create a Project Directory:
uv init fastapi-project
cd fastapi-project


Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

On macOS/Linux:uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate


On Windows:uv venv
.venv\Scripts\activate




Install Dependencies:Install FastAPI, Uvicorn, and testing tools:
uv add "fastapi[standard]"
uv add --dev pytest pytest-asyncio

This updates pyproject.toml with:
[project]
name = "fastapi-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A simple FastAPI project"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
dependencies = [
    "fastapi[standard]>=0.115.0"
]
[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    "pytest>=8.3.2",
    "pytest-asyncio>=0.23.8",
]


Create a Basic API:Edit main.py to include a simple FastAPI application with GET and POST endpoints:
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello from FastAPI + UV!"}

@app.post("/users/")
async def create_user(user: User):
    return {"message": f"User {user.name} created with age {user.age}"}



Running the Application

Start the Server:Run the FastAPI development server:
fastapi dev main.py

Alternatively, use Uvicorn directly:
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000


Test the APIs:Open your browser and visit:

<http://localhost:8000> (returns {"message": "Hello from FastAPI + UV!"})
<http://localhost:8000/users/> (test with a POST request via Swagger UI)


Explore Interactive Docs:Visit <http://localhost:8000/docs> to interact with the API using Swagger UI.


Testing APIs with Swagger UI
FastAPI automatically generates an interactive testing interface at <http://localhost:8000/docs>. With Swagger UI, you can:

View all available API routes.
Test endpoints directly in the browser without writing code.
See request parameters and response formats.

Example:

Go to <http://localhost:8000/docs>.
Find the /users/ POST endpoint.
Click "Try it out", enter a JSON payload like:{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25
}


Click "Execute" to see the response: {"message": "User Alice created with age 25"}.

Troubleshooting Common Issues

Port Already in Use:

Error: Address already in use.
Solution: Change the port with --port 8001 or stop the process using the port:lsof -i :8000
kill -9 <PID>




Module Not Found:

Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'.
Solution: Ensure the virtual environment is activated and FastAPI is installed:uv add "fastapi[standard]"




Invalid JSON Payload:

Error: 422 Unprocessable Entity in Swagger UI.
Solution: Check the JSON format and ensure required fields (e.g., name, age) are included.
